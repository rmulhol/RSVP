  <h3>What Does it Do?</h3>
  <p>The RSVP App helps you organize and manage your events. Tell us when and where your event is happening, and we'll handle the rest.</p>
  <h3>How do I use it?</h3>
  <p>First, <%= link_to "log in", login_path %> or <%= link_to "sign up", signup_path %>. Then, create your event and notify your guests. Once they respond, we make it easy for you to see who's coming and if anyone has claimed any responsibilities.</p>
